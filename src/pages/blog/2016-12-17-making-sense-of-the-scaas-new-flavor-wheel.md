# **What is HClO?**

Hypochlorous acid (HClO), a naturally occurring molecule produced by immune system, is highly active against bacteria, viral, and fungal microorganisms. It provides a unique power to eradicate dangerous organisms while causing harmless to our cells. HClO is one of the agents that is both non-toxic to the delicate cells that can heal our wounds while being lethal to almost all known dangerous bacteria and viruses that threaten our health.

 

HClO is a weak acid which forms when chlorine dissolves in water, and itself partially dissociates, forming hypochlorite (ClO-). Both HClO and ClO- are oxidizers, as well as the primary disinfection agents of chlorine solutions. Natural HClO is unstable, through technology, it can be stabilized into an effective topical antiseptic agent.

## **A slightly acidic Hypochlorous Acid**

[K-clean](https://www.k-clean.com.hk) contains hypochlorous acid and has a pH value of around 5. Its strong oxidizing capability enables it to kill invading bacteria and viruses instantly and to sterilize the targets effectively. Allways Technology Corp. applied nanotechnology to control the structure of water molecules and produced this high-concentration and high-stability hypochlorous acid solution.

 

In 2002, Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Hypochlorous Acid for the indirect used in food contact substances and processing reusable medical and dental devices.

 

Moreover, K-clean will be broken down into slightly acidic saline after reacting with microorganisms. Consequently, it is harmless to the human body and our Earth.

The production plant of K-clean gains GMP certification and obtains the Medical Device Permit Class II from Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare. 

 

Allways Technology Corp. appointed Superlab Taiwan to execute and complete the test for EV71 and such tenacious virus is proven to be terminated by K-clean in only 3 minutes. Its range of HClO products are also approved by Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare for indirect use in food contact substances. Furthermore, it acquired the Medical Device Permit Class I from Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare for another production line of its HClO product, namely ATK, which contains the same ingredient as K-clean.

**Q: What is the difference between K-clean and electrolyzed HClO?**

A:[ K-clean](https://www.k-clean.com.hk/products) is produced by using chemical synthesis. It can be adjusted the concentration for different purposes. Its disinfection power and stability are better than electrolyzed HClO under the same concentration and pH value. It can be preserved for two years in well-sealed and cool condition. For electrolyzed HClO, since it is produced by using electrolysis method, it decomposes easily so that the preservation period is short (only few days to six months).

 

**Q: Will my hands turn dry by using K-clean?**

A: Different from common alkaline hand sanitizers or disinfectants in the market, K-clean is a slightly acidic HClO Antibacterial Fluid of which its main ingredients are hypochlorous acid and multi-purified water. K-clean has pH value of around 5, together with the water molecules possessed inside, achieves 100% skin-friendly.

**Q: How does K-clean perform the disinfection?**

A: K-clean is a slightly acidic HClO fluid, which is a strong oxidizing disinfection agent, kills invading bacteria and viruses instantly. It reacts with the enzymes on the cell wall of the bacteria, rendering it inactive and incapable of producing new cells. Thus, it performs the effect of reducing bacteria. Besides, K-clean destroys virus proteins by strong oxidation, rendering them inactive, preventing them from living in an organism as a parasite. Thus, it achieves the effect of eliminating virus. Comparing with other disinfectants, the time of disinfection of K-clean is much shorter. According to the lab test reports from SGS, K-clean can kill Enterovirus,  Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger in 5 seconds.

 

**Q: Should K-clean be diluted while using?**

A: K-clean is produced by applying the nanotechnology from U.S.A. which can maximize the performance of hypochlorous acid. Therefore, it is not necessary to dilute K-clean while using.

 

**Q: Which is the difference between K-clean and diluted bleach?**

A: The pH value and the ppm of HClO of K-clean is around 5.0 ± 0.5 and 200 ppm* respectively. There is no residue after reacting with microorganisms. Totally harmless is for human and environment. The pH value of diluted bleach is 9 or above which is highly irritative for human skin. It is also harmful for our respiratory system.

\* HClO level may vary depending on the storage conditions.

**Q:  Is there any side effect for human or pets by using K-clean in long-term?**

A: K-clean will be broken down into slightly acidic saline after reacting with microorganisms, not harmful for human and pets. In 2002, Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved hypochlorous acid for the indirect use in food contact substances. Furthermore, hypochlorous acid has also passed the safety test for pet use. However, it is not recommended for person who is allergic to chlorine.

 

**Q: Can K-clean be drunk? Or use for mouthwash?**

A: K-clean is mainly used for sanitizing purpose, for external use only. However, there is laboratory report showing that hypochlorous acid can be used for mouthwash. Many dentists are also widely using hypochlorous acid for mouth disinfection purpose in the foreign countries. It is recommended to use 10 ml of K-clean, gargle for 5 seconds and spit out. Do not swallow. 

 

**Q: What is the difference between K-clean and alcohol sanitizer?**

A: Alcohol sanitizer can destroy viral envelope but not for its capsid, i.e. alcohol cannot kill non-enveloped virus effectively, such as Enterovirus. If the concentration of alcohol is lower than 50%, it is useless for disinfection. K-clean destroys either the enzymes on the cell wall of the bacteria or the virus protein by strong oxidation, rendering them inactive, in order to execute sanitization.

 

**Q: Can K-clean remove pesticide residue by soaking?**

A: According to laboratory test, K-clean can remove pesticide residue effectively. It is because HClO can react with pesticide and decompose it. It is recommended to rinse by tap water after soaking.
