## **Origin of Hypochlorous Acid**

All living organisms on Earth are made up of cells. They rely on them for their survival. Constant metastases of cells to survive, while new and old cells To produce new enzymes (amino acid) you will need to rely upon the conversion of enzymes Cells in the metabolic process. Prokaryotic cells are bacteria. Contains enzymes that are mostly found on the cell walls. K-clean reacts with enzymes making it inactive. Producing new cells and thereby achieving the effect on reducing bacteria

Viruses do not possess complete cell structures and require hosts to survive. They are made up of genetic material with nucleic acid and protein shells. K-clean's strong oxidizing ability will destroy viruses' proteins They are rendered inactive and cannot live in an organism. Parasites can be killed to achieve disinfection.

Human beings and animals are eukaryotic cells organisms that have enzymes. Taurine is found on the surface of cells and within the cell membrane.  K-clean can be used in contact with human cells. First, be broken down by taurine without damaging enzymes. This could affect the production of new cells. K-clean will also be after reacting with, it is broken down into slightly acidic salt. It is not harmful to the human body because it contains microorganisms.

## **What forms the HClO?**

Hypochlorous acid, a naturally occurring molecule that is produced by the immune system, is extremely active against bacteria, viruses, and fungal microorganisms. It has the unique ability to kill dangerous organisms and yet be harmless to our cells. HClO is a non-toxic agent that can heal wounds and is lethal to most dangerous bacteria and viruses.

HClO, a weak acid, forms in the presence of chlorine. It partially dissociates from water and forms hypochlorite (ClO –). Both ClO – and HClO are oxidizers. Although natural HClO is inherently unstable, technology can stabilize it to make it an effective topical antiseptic.

Hypochlorous acid is a bactericidal component secreted by human white blood cells, especially used to destroy the cell wall of bacteria and viruses, so that bacteria and viruses can not survive, because of the affinity with the human body, it does not harm the human body.

[K-clean ](https://www.k-clean.com.hk/en/)is a weak acid hypochlorous acid water, with super oxidation power, rapid sterilization, disinfection function, and the use of unique technical formula, hypochlorous acid to play the maximum effect, and can increase its effective period and stability.

Another component - six rings micro molecular pure water (0.07 degrees) : high purity of water, when the micro molecular pure water and hypochlorous acid combined, can play the maximum bactericidal effect, in the condition of no light can improve the shelf life.

The slightly acidic hypochlorous acid water has been approved as a food additive by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and the U.S. National Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002. When in contact with microorganisms and organic matter, immediately reduced to saltwater, very safe, and because of the low concentration of hypochlorous acid components, can be quickly decomposed after use, will not produce harmful substances residue, so harmless to the environment and human body.
