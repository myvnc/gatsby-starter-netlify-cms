## The Birth of Z Dot Com

GMO Internet, Japan’s largest Registrar Agent has purchased the Z.com domain (press release) from Nissan for 800 million yen ($6.8million).

Jon Postel held all second-level domains of letter or number in the.com,.edu and.net gTLDs to ensure future Internet extensibility. These domains were thus registered in the name IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), which Postel founded and supervised until his death in 1998, after complications following a surgical procedure.



There were 6 domains of the total of 144 that could be reserved, but they could not be because they had been registered previously. They are:



Qwest Communications International Inc.\
**x.com** : eBay Inc . PayPal. PayPal used to be known as X.com Corp.\
**z.com** - Nissan North America's Z sport cars. Nissan understood domains in 1999 (Case Nissan Vs Nissan).\
**i.net** is used by Inet Corp., a domain registration firm.\
**q.net** - Registered by Q Networks. The last activity on the website was in 1997.\
**x.org** – Home page for the Open Group Foundation (now X.Org Foundation), who maintains the graphical technology for X Windows and Unix.



Nissan used the domain for promotion of its Nissan Fairlady Z sportscar. It was manufactured from late 2002 to 2009. The Nissan 370Z replaced it.
