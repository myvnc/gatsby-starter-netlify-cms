Let’s get started with a summary.

### **Key points**

* The foreign exchange (also known as FX or foreign exchange) market is a global market for the exchange of domestic currencies.
* As trade, commerce and finance spread all over the world, the foreign exchange market is often the largest and most liquid asset market in the world.
* Currencies trade with each other in the form of exchange rate pairs. For example, EUR/USD is a currency pair used to trade the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
* The foreign exchange market exists in the form of a spot (cash) market and a derivative market that provides forwards, futures, options and currency swaps.
* Market participants use foreign exchange to hedge international currency and interest rate risks, speculate on geopolitical events, and diversify investment portfolios for several reasons.

## **What is the foreign exchange market?**

The foreign exchange market is a place where currencies are traded. Currency is important because goods and services can be purchased locally and across borders. Foreign trade and business activities need to be exchanged for international currencies.

If you live in the United States and want to buy cheese from France, you or the company that buys the cheese must pay the French for cheese in Euros (EUR). This means that U.S. importers must convert the equivalent value of U.S. dollars (USD) into euros. The same is true for travel. French tourists in Egypt cannot pay in euros to see the pyramids because it is not a locally accepted currency. Therefore, the tourist must convert the euro to the local currency at the current exchange rate, in this case the Egyptian pound.

A unique aspect of this international market is that there is no central market for foreign exchange transactions. In contrast, currency transactions are conducted through electronic over-the-counter (OTC), which means that all transactions are conducted through a computer network between traders around the world, rather than on a centralized exchange.

The market is open 24 hours a day, 5 and a half days a week, and currencies are traded globally in major financial centers such as London, New York, Tokyo, Zurich, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, Paris, and Sydney—in almost every time zone around the world. This means that when the trading day in the United States ends, the foreign exchange markets in Tokyo and Hong Kong will restart. Therefore, the foreign exchange market can be very active at any time of the day, and quotes are constantly changing.

## **A brief history of foreign exchange**

In the most basic sense, the foreign exchange market has existed for centuries. People always exchange or exchange goods and currencies to buy goods and services. However, as we understand today, the foreign exchange market is a relatively modern invention.

 After the Bretton Woods Agreement was reached in 1971, more currencies were allowed to float freely. The value of individual currencies varies according to demand and circulation, and is monitored by foreign exchange trading services.

Commercial banks and investment banks conduct most transactions in the foreign exchange market on behalf of their clients, but professional and individual investors also have speculative opportunities to trade one currency with another.

Currency as an asset class has two different characteristics:

* You can earn the interest rate difference between the two currencies.
* You can profit from changes in exchange rates.

An  investor can profit from the difference between  two interest rates in two different economies by buying currencies with higher interest rates and shorting currencies with lower interest rates. Before the 2008 financial crisis, it was very common to short the yen (JPY) to buy the British pound (GBP) due to the large interest rate differential. This strategy is sometimes called “arbitrage trading . “

### **Why can we trade currencies**

Before the advent of the Internet, it was difficult for individual investors to conduct currency transactions. Most currency traders are large multinational companies, hedge funds or high-net-worth individuals, because foreign exchange transactions require large amounts of capital. With the help of the Internet, a retail market for individual traders has emerged. Through the establishment of a secondary market by banks or brokers, they can easily enter the foreign exchange market. Most online brokers or dealers provide individual traders with very high leverage, who can control large transactions with a small account balance.

## **Foreign exchange market overview**

The foreign exchange market is where currencies are traded. It is the only truly continuous and uninterrupted trading market in the world. In the past, the foreign exchange market was dominated by institutional companies and large banks that acted on behalf of customers. But in recent years it has become more retail-oriented, and many traders and investors with large holdings have begun to participate.

An interesting aspect of the world foreign exchange market is that there is no physical building as a trading place for the market. Instead, it is a series of connections established through a trading terminal and a computer network. Participants in this market are institutions, investment banks, commercial banks and retail investors.

Compared with other financial markets, the foreign exchange market is considered more opaque. Currency is traded in the over-the-counter market, and disclosure is not mandatory. Large liquidity pools from institutional companies are a common feature of the market. People will assume that the economic parameters of a country should be the most important criterion for determining its price. but it is not the truth. The 2019 survey found that the motivations of large financial institutions played the most important role in determining currency prices.

There are three ways of foreign exchange trading. They are as follows:

### **Spot market**

Foreign exchange transactions in the spot market have always been the largest, because it is the largest “foundation” physical asset for forward and futures market transactions. Previously, the trading volume of futures and forward markets surpassed that of the spot market.

However, with the advent of electronic trading and the proliferation of foreign exchange brokers, the trading volume in the foreign exchange spot market has been boosted. When people refer to the foreign exchange market, they usually refer to the spot market. The forward and futures markets are often more popular with companies that need to hedge foreign exchange risks on a specific date in the future.

### **How does the spot market work?**

The spot market is a place where currencies are bought and sold based on their transaction prices. The price is determined by supply and demand and is calculated based on a number of factors, including current interest rates, economic performance, sentiment about the current political situation (local and international), and views on the future performance of one currency against another. 

The final transaction is called a “spot transaction.” It is a bilateral transaction in which one party delivers an agreed amount of currency to the other party and receives a specified amount of another currency at an agreed exchange rate value. After closing the position, it will be settled in cash. Although the spot market is often referred to as a market that processes current (rather than future) transactions, these transactions actually take two days to settle.

### **Forward and futures markets**

A forward contract is a private agreement between two parties to purchase currency in the over-the-counter market at a predetermined price on a future date. A futures contract is a standardized agreement between two parties to deliver currency at a predetermined price on a future date.

Unlike the spot market, the forward and futures markets do not trade real currencies. Instead, the contracts they trade represent requirements for a certain currency type, a specific price per unit, and a future settlement date.

In the forward market, a contract is an over-the-counter sale between two parties, and both parties decide on the terms of the agreement. In the futures market, futures contracts are bought and sold according to the standard size and settlement date of the public commodity market (such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange).

In the United States, the National Futures Association is responsible for overseeing the futures market. Futures contracts have specific details, including the number of trading units, delivery and settlement dates, and minimum price increments that cannot be customized. As the counterparty of traders, the exchange provides clearing and settlement.

Both types of contracts are binding and are usually settled in cash at the relevant exchange when they expire, although the contract can also be bought and sold before expiration. Currency forward and futures markets can provide risk protection when trading currencies. Usually, large international companies use these markets to hedge against future exchange rate fluctuations, but speculators also participate in these markets.

Please note that you will often see the following terms: FX, foreign exchange, foreign exchange market and currency market. These terms are synonyms and refer to the foreign exchange market.

## **Foreign exchange hedging**

Companies that do business abroad face risks due to currency fluctuations when they buy and sell goods and services outside of their domestic markets. The foreign exchange market provides a way to hedge currency risks by fixing the transaction completion rate.

To this end, traders can buy and sell currencies in the forward or swap market in advance to lock in the exchange rate. For example, suppose a company plans to sell American-made blenders in Europe when the exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar (EUR/USD) is 1 to 1 U.S. dollar.

The manufacturing cost of the blender is US$100, and the American company plans to sell it at a price of 150 euros-which is competitive with other blenders made in Europe. If this plan is successful, the company will get a profit of $50, because the euro/dollar exchange rate is equal. Unfortunately, the U.S. dollar began to appreciate against the euro until the EUR/USD exchange rate was 0.80, which means that the cost of buying 1.00 Euro now is 0.80 U.S. dollars.

The problem the company faces is that although the cost of manufacturing the blender is still US$100, the company can only sell the product at a competitive price of 150 euros, which is only 120 US dollars after conversion (150 euros X 0.80 = 120 US dollars) ). The strengthening of the U.S. dollar caused profits to be much lower than expected.

Blender companies could have reduced this risk by shorting euros and buying dollars at parity. In this way, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, trade profits will offset the reduced profits from the sale of mixers. If the U.S. dollar depreciates, a more favorable exchange rate will increase the profit of selling mixers, thereby offsetting trade losses.

This hedging can be done in the currency futures market. The advantage of traders is that futures contracts are standardized and cleared by central agencies. However, currency futures may not be as liquid as forward markets, which are fragmented and exist in interbank systems around the world.

## **Foreign exchange speculation**

Similar factors such as interest rates, trade flows, tourism, economic strength and geopolitical risks affect the supply and demand of money, which will fluctuate daily in the foreign exchange market. There are opportunities to profit from changes that may increase or decrease the value of one currency compared to another. The prediction that one currency will weaken is basically the same as the assumption that the other currency in the currency pair will strengthen, because currencies are traded in pairs.

Suppose a trader expects that the interest rate in the United States will be higher than that in Australia, and the exchange rate between the two currencies (AUD/USD) is 0.71 (it takes 0.71 USD to buy USD 1.00). Traders believe that rising U.S. interest rates will increase demand for the U.S. dollar, and therefore the AUD/USD exchange rate will fall because fewer U.S. dollars are needed to buy Australian dollars and stronger.

Assuming that the trader is correct and the interest rate rises, this reduces the AUD/USD exchange rate to 0.50. This means that the purchase of AUD 1.00 requires USD 0.50. If investors short-circuit the Australian dollar for a long dollar, they will profit from the change in value.
