Denominations of banknotes: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 yuan in seven types. Large-denomination banknotes of 500 and 1,000 yuan denominations were previously issued, but they are no longer in circulation. There are 1 point, 5 points, 10 points, 25 points, 50 points, etc. for tokens

Since 1913, the United States established the Federal Reserve System and issued Federal Reserve Notes. More than 99% of the current banknotes in circulation are Federal Reserve Notes. The right to issue US dollars belongs to the U.S.  Department of the Treasury, and the competent authority is the Treasury. 

The Federal Reserve Bank is responsible for the specific issuance business. The US dollar is the base currency in foreign exchange exchanges and the main currency in international payments and foreign exchange transactions. It occupies a very important position in the international foreign exchange market.

2. ***The U.S. dollar is also known as the "green back" <br>***
   The earliest paper currency in the United States was approved for issuance by the "Continental Conference" of the coalition regime of 13 colonies, called "Continental Currency." In 1863, the Ministry of Finance was authorized to start issuing banknotes, printed on the back in green, which is called "green back" and is still in use today.<br>

### **(2) Description of the US dollar index**

Unexpectedly, the US dollar index does not come from CBOT or CME, but from the New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE). Founded in 1870, the New York Cotton Exchange was initially formed by a group of cotton merchants and intermediaries. It is currently the oldest commodity exchange in New York and the most important cotton futures and option exchange in the world. 

In 1985, the New York Cotton Exchange established a financial department and formally entered the global financial commodity market. The first to be launched was the US dollar index futures. The calculation principle of US dollar index futures is based on the trade volume between major countries in the world and the United States, and calculates the overall strength of the US dollar in a weighted manner, with 100 as the dividing line between strength and weakness. A total of 10 countries have been adopted as the calculation targets, with Euro, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, and British Pound as the mainstay. Price influencing factors <br>

### **The overall performance of the U.S. economy-currency strength is a manifestation of national strength**

**a. Trade Deficit** <br>
The U.S. economy has continued to expand since the second half of 1999. Imports have continued to increase substantially due to stronger consumer demand and the substantial expansion of corporate investment. However, exports have not been able to grow along with them, leading to the continued expansion of the trade deficit gap. It stands to reason that this At this time, it must be resolved through the effect of currency devaluation, but because the United States still adheres to a strong dollar policy, its trade deficit continues to expand, and this will inevitably affect the strong position of the dollar in the long run.

**b. Unemployment Rate (Unemployment Rate)**<br>
At the end of 1999, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to the lowest level since the 1960s. Due to concerns that the labor market contraction would lead to inflation, which would reduce corporate profits, the FED began to adopt a series of tightening monetary policies, which almost caused a hard landing in the U.S. economy. The unemployment rate In March 2001, it reached a new high in recent years.

**c. Profit Earning**<br>
Affected by the sharp increase in labor costs, capital costs, and the slowdown in consumption, the profitability of US companies has been declining year by year. Since the beginning of this year, the continuous release of corporate profit warnings and downward adjustments to financial forecasts will seriously affect the strong position of the US economy. threat.

**d. Growth of Productivity**<br>
To continue to grow productivity, even if labor costs increase, even if employment costs rise, it will not lead to inflation. Therefore, the key to a smooth soft landing for the United States will fall on productivity. However, since the beginning of this year, capital utilization and capital equipment expenditures have repeatedly hit new lows, which is not optimistic news for the increase in productivity. Recently, all walks of life, including Greenspan, have urged the Bush administration to accelerate the cultivation of skilled labor, and this plan will have the opportunity to significantly improve the structure of the labor force, thereby increasing productivity. On the whole, it is estimated that this year's productivity growth will gradually flatten out, and it still has the power to curb inflation.<br>

### **Trends in U.S. interest rates**

Since the United States has a fairly strong and independent central bank, monetary decisions have a critical influence on the overall performance of the economy. Therefore, every routine interest rate adjustment meeting of the Federal Reserve will have a more or less impact on the foreign exchange market. Since interest rates directly affect the fixed income of foreign currency deposits, the strength of the US dollar index has been greatly impacted by interest rate adjustments. 

In the past years when there was an emphasis on fixed currency returns, the higher the deposit interest rate of a country’s currency could attract more international funds for arbitrage, which made the exchange rate stronger. 

The overall performance of the stock market is unfavorable. Instead, international funds are repatriated from countries that have adopted tightening monetary policies, and the exchange rate has also weakened. The trend of interest rates depends on the above-mentioned overall economic factors, such as inflation rate, money supply growth rate, economic growth rate, and central bank policies. Therefore, the market's expectations of the future US interest rate level will affect the price of the US dollar index.

(a) **Stock market performance**<br>
   If a country’s stock market performs well, it will attract international capital into investment, which in turn will drive the exchange rate upward. Representing this new economic boom in Baumian stocks, the staggeringly high return on investment has made high-tech stocks the world's super attracting money machine, and the U.S. stocks and foreign exchange markets have also started a wave of long markets.<br><br>
(b) **The relative strength of other major currencies-Euro**<br>
   After the launch of the euro, the Deutsche mark, French franc, Italian lira, Dutch dollar, and Belgian franc were combined into one. The euro has become the most important currency with weight, accounting for 57.6% of the total U.S. dollar index, which has a huge impact. The value also tends to concentrate on the euro, the yen, and the pound sterling. Therefore, the monetary policy trends of the European Central Bank and the economic performance of the Eurozone are indispensable elements for observing the strength of the US dollar index.<br>

### **Factors affecting the US dollar**

Fundamental factors affecting the U.S. dollar
Federal Reserve Bank (Fed): The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, abbreviated as the Federal Reserve, the United States Central Bank, formulates monetary policies completely independently to ensure the maximum degree of non-inflationary growth in the economy. Fed's main policy indicators include: open market operations, discount rate (Discount Rate), federal funds rate (Fed Funds rate).

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC): Federal Open Market Committee. The FOMC is mainly responsible for formulating monetary policy, including making 8 key interest rate adjustment announcements a year. The FOMC has a total of 12 members, including 7 government officials, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and 4 other members elected from the presidents of the other 11 local Federal Reserve Banks for a one-year term.

Interest Rates: Interest rate, namely Fed Funds Rate, is the most important interest rate indicator, and it is also the overnight loan interest rate for mutual loans between savings institutions. When the Fed hopes to send a clear monetary policy signal to the market, it will announce a new level of interest rates. Each such announcement will cause greater turbulence in the stock, bond and currency markets.

Discount Rate: The discount rate is the interest rate charged by the Fed when commercial banks apply for loans from the Fed due to emergency situations such as reserves. Although this is a symbolic interest rate indicator, its changes will also express strong policy signals. The discount rate is generally less than the federal funds rate.

30-year Treasury Bond: 30-year Treasury Bonds, also called long-term bonds, are the most important indicators for the market to measure inflation. In many cases in the market, bond yields rather than prices are used to measure bond grades. Like all claims, 30-year Treasury bills are negatively correlated with prices. There is no clear link between long-term bonds and the exchange rate of the US dollar. However, there is generally the following link: a fall in bond prices due to inflation, that is, an increase in yields, may put pressure on the US dollar. These considerations may be caused by some economic data.

However, with the implementation of the U.S. Treasury Department's "borrowing new debt to repay the old debt" plan, the issuance of 30-year Treasury bills began to shrink, and then the status of 30-year Treasury bills as a benchmark began to give way to 10-year Treasury bills.

According to different stages of the economic cycle, some economic indicators have different effects on the US dollar: when inflation does not become a threat to the economy, strong economic indicators will support the US dollar exchange rate; when the threat of inflation to the economy is more obvious, strong Economic indicators will suppress the US dollar exchange rate, one of the means is to sell bonds.

As a benchmark for asset levels, long-term bonds are generally affected by global capital flows. Financial or political turmoil in emerging markets will push up U.S. dollar assets. At this time, U.S. dollar assets, as a hedging tool, will indirectly push up the U.S. dollar exchange rate.

3-month Eurodollar Deposits: 3-month Eurodollar Deposits. Eurodollars refer to U.S. dollar deposits held in foreign banks in the United States. For example, the Japanese yen deposits deposited in Japanese banks and foreign banks are called "European Japanese Yen". This difference in deposit interest rates can be used as a valuable benchmark for evaluating foreign exchange interest rates. For example, take the USD/JPY as an example. When the positive difference between Eurodollar and Euroyen deposits is greater, the USD/JPY exchange rate is more likely to be supported.

10-year Treasury Note: 10-year short-term Treasury bill. When we compare the yields of the same types of bonds between countries, we generally use 10-year short-term Treasury bills. The difference in bond yields will affect the exchange rate. If the return on USD assets is high, the exchange rate will push up the USD exchange rate.

Treasury: Ministry of Finance. The U.S. Treasury Department is responsible for issuing government bonds and formulating fiscal budgets. The Ministry of Finance has no say in monetary policy, but its comments on the U.S. dollar may have a greater impact on the U.S. dollar exchange rate.

**Economic Data:** Economic data. Among the economic data released by the United States, the most important ones include: labor force report (salary level, unemployment rate and average hourly income), CPI (Consumer Price Index), PPI, GDP (gross domestic product, gross domestic product) , The level of international trade, industrial production, housing starts, housing permits and consumer confidence.

**Stock Market:** Stock market. The three main stock indexes are: Dow Jones Industrials Index (Dow, Dow Jones Industrials Index), S&P 500 (Standard & Poor's 500 Index) and NASDAQ (Nasdaq Index). Among them, the Dow Jones Industrial Index has the greatest impact on the US dollar exchange rate. Since the mid-1990s, the Dow Jones Industrials Index and the US dollar exchange rate have had a great positive correlation (because of the purchase of US assets by foreign investors). The three main factors affecting the Dow Jones Industrial Index are: 1) company income, including expected and actual income; 2) interest rate expectations; 3) global political and economic conditions.

**Cross Rate Effect:** Cross rate effect. The rise and fall of the cross trading will also affect the US dollar exchange rate.

Fed Funds Rate Futures Contract: Fed Funds Rate Futures Contract. This contract value shows the market's expected value of the federal funds rate (related to the expiry date of the contract), and is the most direct measure of Fed policy.

**3-month Eurodollar Futures Contract**: 3-month Eurodollar Futures Contract. Like the federal funds rate futures contract, the 3-month Eurodollar futures contract also has an impact on the 3-month Eurodollar deposits. For example, the interest rate difference between the 3-month Eurodollar futures contract and the 3-month European yen futures contract is the basic change that determines the future trend of USD/JPY.
