 When valuing a country’s currency in another country’s currency, fundamental analysis includes the study of macroeconomic indicators, asset markets, and political factors. Macroeconomic indicators include figures such as economic growth rates, which are calculated from factors such as gross domestic product, interest rate, inflation rate, unemployment rate, money supply, foreign exchange reserves, and productivity. The asset market includes stocks, bonds and real estate. Political factors will affect the trust in a country's government, social stability, and confidence.

Sometimes the government will intervene in the currency market to prevent the currency from deviating significantly from undesirable levels. Intervention in the money market is executed by the central bank and usually has a significant but temporary impact on the foreign exchange market. The central bank can unilaterally buy/sell its own currency in another country's currency, or jointly intervene with other central banks in order to achieve more significant results. Or, some countries can try to influence currency changes only by issuing hints or threats of intervention.

## **Basic theory**

1. **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)**<br>
   Purchasing power parity theory stipulates that the exchange rate is determined by the relative prices of the same group of commodities. Changes in the inflation rate should be offset by changes in the exchange rate of the same amount but in the opposite direction. Take a classic example of a hamburger. If a hamburger is worth US$2.00 in the United States and a pound 1.00 in the United Kingdom, then according to the theory of purchasing power parity, the exchange rate must be US$2 per pound. If the prevailing market exchange rate is 1.7 U.S. dollars per British pound, then the British pound is called an undervalued currency and the U.S. dollar is called an overvalued currency. This theory assumes that the two currencies will eventually change to a 2:1 relationship.

The main disadvantage of the purchasing power parity theory lies in its assumption that goods can be freely traded, and transaction costs such as tariffs, quotas, and taxes are not counted. Another shortcoming is that it only applies to goods, but ignores services, and services can have a very significant gap in value. In addition, in addition to the difference in inflation rate and interest rate, there are several other factors that affect the exchange rate, such as: economic data release/report, asset market, and political development. Before the 1990s, the purchasing power parity theory lacked factual evidence to prove its validity. After the 1990s, this theory seems to only apply to long periods (3-5 years). In such a span of the cycle, the price eventually moved closer to parity.

2. **Interest rate parity (IRP)**<br>
   Interest rate parity stipulates that the appreciation (depreciation) of one currency against another will be offset by changes in interest rate differences. If the US interest rate is higher than the Japanese interest rate, then the dollar will depreciate against the yen, and the extent of the depreciation depends on the prevention of risk-free arbitrage. The future exchange rate will be reflected in the forward exchange rate specified on the day. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is considered a discount because the Japanese yen purchased at the forward exchange rate is less than the Japanese yen purchased at the spot exchange rate. The yen is considered a premium.

After the 1990s, there is no evidence that the interest parity theory is still valid. Contrary to this theory, currencies with high interest rates generally do not depreciate, but increase in value due to the long-term suppression of inflation and being a highly efficient currency.

3. **The balance of payments model**<br>
   This model believes that the foreign exchange rate must be at its equilibrium level-that is, an exchange rate that can generate a stable current account balance. A country with a trade deficit will reduce its foreign exchange reserves and eventually reduce (depreciate) the value of its currency. Cheap currency makes the country's goods more price advantage in the international market, but also makes imported products more expensive. After a period of adjustment, the volume of imports was forced to fall, and the volume of exports rose, thereby stabilizing the balance of trade and currency.

Like the purchasing power parity theory, the international balance of payments model mainly focuses on traded goods and services, while ignoring the increasingly important role of global capital flows. In other words, money is not only chasing goods and services, but more broadly, it chases financial assets such as stocks and bonds. Such capital flows enter the capital account of the balance of payments, which can balance the deficit in the current account. The increase in capital flows gave rise to the asset market model.

4. **Asset market model (the best model so far)**<br>
   The rapid expansion of trade in financial assets (stocks and bonds) has given analysts and traders a new perspective on currencies. Economic variables such as growth rate, inflation rate and productivity are no longer the only drivers of currency changes. The share of foreign exchange transactions originating from cross-border financial asset transactions has dwarfed currency transactions arising from trade in goods and services.

The asset market approach treats currency as the price of an asset traded in an efficient financial market. Therefore, currency increasingly shows its close relationship with asset markets, especially stocks.

5. **The U.S. dollar and the U.S. asset market**<br>
   In the summer of 1999, many authorities believed that the U.S. dollar would depreciate against the euro, citing the growing U.S. current account deficit and the overheating of the Wall Street economy. The theoretical basis for this view is that non-US investors will withdraw funds from the US stock and bond markets and invest them in markets with healthier economic conditions, thereby drastically depressing the value of the US dollar. And such fears have not dissipated since the early 1980s. At that time, the U.S. current account quickly grew to a record high, accounting for 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP).

Just as in the 1980s, foreign investors still have such a greedy appetite for American assets. But unlike in the 1980s, the fiscal deficit disappeared in the 1990s. Although the growth rate of foreign holdings of U.S. bonds may have slowed down, the continuous injection of large amounts of funds into the U.S. stock market is enough to offset this slowdown. When the US bubble bursts, non-US investors are most likely to choose safer US Treasury bills, rather than Eurozone or British stocks, because Eurozone or British stocks are likely to be hit hard in the above incident. In the crisis of November 1998 and the panic caused by the false statements of Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan in December 1996, such situations have already occurred. In the first case, the net purchases of foreign Treasury bills almost tripled to US$44 billion; in the latter case, this indicator surged more than tenfold to US$25 billion.

In the past two decades, the balance of payments law has been replaced by the asset market law in estimating the behavior of the dollar. Although the improvement of the fundamental elements of the Eurozone economy will surely help this young currency regain its lost ground, it is difficult to support this recovery by relying solely on fundamental elements. Today, there still exists the credit problem of the European Central Bank; up to now, the creditworthiness of the European Central Bank is inversely proportional to the frequent verbal support of the euro. The looming risks of the government stability of the Eurozone’s Big Three (Germany, France, and Italy) and the expansion of the European Monetary Union are also seen as potential obstacles to the single currency.

At present, the stability of the US dollar can be attributed to the following factors: zero inflation growth, the safe haven nature of the US asset market, and the euro risk mentioned above.

## **Economic indicators**

### **A. Gross domestic product<br>**

  ** *(1) The meaning of GDP***
Gross Domestic Product (Gross Domestic Product) refers to the value of all final products and services produced in the economy of a country or region within a certain period of time (one quarter or one year). It is often recognized as a measure of the country’s economic status. The best indicator. It can not only reflect a country's economic performance, but also reflect a country's national strength and wealth. Generally speaking, there are four different components of GDP, including consumption, private investment, government spending, and net exports. Expressed by the formula as:

GDP: C+I+C+X where: C is consumption, I is private investment, C is government expenditure, and X is net exports.

Whether the economy of a country or region is in a stage of growth or decline can be observed from the change in this number. Generally speaking, there are no more than two forms of GDP announcement, with the total and percentage rate as the unit of calculation. When the GDP growth number is positive, it means that the region’s economy is in an expansion phase; conversely, if it’s negative, it means that the region’s economy has entered a period of recession. Since GDP refers to the total amount of goods and services produced in a certain period of time multiplied by the "currency price" or "market price", it is the nominal GDP. The nominal GDP growth rate is equal to the sum of the real GDP growth rate and the inflation rate. Therefore, even if the total output does not increase, but the price level rises, the nominal GDP will still rise. In the case of price increases, the increase in GDP is only an illusion. However, it is the rate of change of real GDP that has a substantial impact. Therefore, when using GDP as an indicator, the GDP deflation index must be used to adjust the nominal GDP to accurately reflect output. The actual changes. Therefore, an increase in the GDP deflation index in a quarter is enough to indicate the inflation situation in the current quarter. If the GDP deflation index increases significantly, it will have a negative impact on the economy, and it will also be a harbinger of the tightening of the money supply, the rise in interest rates, and the rise in foreign exchange rates.

***(2) Interpretation of GDP***
The substantial increase in a country’s GDP reflects the country’s vigorous economic development, increasing national income and increasing consumption power. In this case, the country’s central bank will likely increase interest rates and tighten the money supply. The country’s economic performance and rising interest rates will increase the attractiveness of the country’s currency. Conversely, if a country’s GDP shows negative growth, it indicates that the country’s economy is in recession and its consumption power is reduced. At that time, the country’s central bank may cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth again. The decline in interest rates and the weak economic performance will reduce the attractiveness of the country’s currency. Therefore, generally speaking, a high economic growth rate will promote the rise of the national currency exchange rate, while a low economic growth rate will cause the country's currency exchange rate to fall. For example, from 1995 to 1999, the average annual growth rate of GDP in the United States was 4.1%. Among the 11 countries in the Eurozone, except for Ireland (9.0%), the GDP growth rate of major countries such as France, Germany, and Italy was only 2.2%. , 1.5% and 1.2%, which are much lower than the US level. This prompted the euro to decline in its exchange rate against the US dollar since it was launched on January 1, 1999, depreciating by 30% in less than two years. But in fact, the difference in economic growth rates has many effects on exchange rate changes:

First, a country’s high economic growth rate means that income increases and domestic demand levels increase, which will increase the country’s imports, leading to a current account deficit, which will cause the country’s currency exchange rate to fall.

Second, if the country’s economy is export-oriented and economic growth is for the production of more export products, the increase in exports will compensate for the increase in imports and reduce the pressure on the country’s currency exchange rate to fall.

The third is that a country’s high economic growth rate means that labor productivity will increase rapidly, and cost reduction will improve the competitive position of its products, which is conducive to increasing exports and inhibiting imports, and the high economic growth rate makes the country’s currency favored in the foreign exchange market. Therefore, the currency exchange rate of the country will have an upward trend.

In the United States, the Department of Commerce is responsible for the analysis and statistics of GDP, and it is customary to estimate and count it every quarter. Every time the preliminary estimates (The Preliminary Estimates) are published, there will be two revisions (The First Revision & The Final Revision), the main publication time is the third week of each month. GDP is usually used to compare with the same period last year. If it increases, it means that the economy is faster, which is beneficial to the appreciation of its currency; if it decreases, it means that the economy is slowing down, and its currency is under pressure to depreciate. For the United States, a 3% growth in GDP is the ideal level, indicating that the economic development is healthy, and higher than this level indicates currency pressure; growth of less than 1.5% indicates an economic slowdown and There are signs of decline.

### **B. Interest rate**<br>

***(1) The meaning of interest rates***
Interest rate, in terms of its manifestation, refers to the ratio of the amount of interest to the total borrowed capital in a certain period of time. For many years, economists have been working hard to find a set of theories that can fully explain the structure and changes of interest rates. The "classical school" believes that interest rates are the price of capital, and the supply and demand of capital determine the changes in interest rates; Keynes took the interest rate Think of it as "the cost of using money." Marx believed that the interest rate is a part of surplus value, and it is a manifestation of the participation of borrowing capitalists in the distribution of surplus value. Interest rates are usually controlled by the central bank of the country and managed by the Federal Reserve Board in the United States. All countries now regard interest rates as one of the important tools of macroeconomic regulation. When the economy is overheated and inflation rises, interest rates will be raised and credit will be tightened; when the overheated economy and inflation are under control, interest rates will be appropriately lowered. Therefore, interest rates are one of the important basic economic factors.

***(2) Interpretation of interest rates***<br>
The level of interest rates has a very important impact on foreign exchange rates, and interest rates are the most important factor affecting exchange rates. We know that the exchange rate is the relative price between the currencies of two countries. Like the pricing mechanism of other commodities, it is determined by the relationship between supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange is a financial asset, and people hold it because it can bring capital theft. When people choose whether to hold their own currency or a certain foreign currency, they must first consider which currency to hold will bring them greater returns. And the rate of return of each country’s currency is first determined by its financial Measured by market interest rates. If the interest rate of a certain currency rises, the interest income of holding that kind of currency will increase, attracting investors to buy this kind of currency. Therefore, the currency is favorable (the market is optimistic) and support; if the interest rate drops, the holding of this kind of currency The income will be reduced, and the attractiveness of the currency will be weakened. Therefore, it can be said that "the interest rate rises, the currency is strong; the interest rate falls, the currency is weak".

From an economic perspective, when the foreign exchange market is in equilibrium, the benefits of holding any two currencies should be equal, which is: Ri=Rj (interest rate parity conditions). Here, R represents the rate of return, and i and j represent the currencies of different countries. If the benefits of holding two currencies are not equal, arbitrage will occur: buying A foreign exchange and selling B foreign exchange. There is no risk in this kind of arbitrage. Therefore, once the rates of return of the two currencies are not equal, the arbitrage mechanism will make the rates of return of the two currencies equal. That is to say, there is an inherent tendency and trend of equalization in the interest rates of different countries' currencies. This is an interest rate indicator. The key aspects that affect the trend of foreign exchange rates are also the key to our interpretation and grasp of interest rate indicators. For example, after August 1987, as the U.S. dollar fell, people rushed to buy the pound, a high-interest currency, which caused the pound exchange rate to rise from 1.65 U.S. dollars to 1.90 U.S. dollars in a short period of time, an increase of nearly 20%. In order to limit the rise of the pound, the United Kingdom lowered interest rates several times from May to June 1988, from 10% to 7.5%. With each interest rate cut, the pound would fall. However, due to the rapid depreciation of the pound sterling and increased inflationary pressures, the Bank of England was forced to raise interest rates several times, and the pound exchange rate began to gradually rise again.

Under the conditions of an open economy, the scale of international capital flows is huge, which greatly exceeds the volume of international trade, indicating the tremendous development of financial globalization. The impact of interest rate differences on exchange rate changes is more important than in the past. When a country tightens credit, interest rates will rise, and interest rate differentials will be formed in the international market, which will cause short-term funds to move internationally. Capital generally always flows from countries with low interest rates to countries with high interest rates. In this way, if the interest rate level of a country is higher than that of other countries, it will attract a large number of capital inflows, and the outflow of domestic funds will decrease, leading to the rush to buy this currency in the international market; at the same time, the capital account balance will be improved and the domestic currency exchange rate will be increased. Conversely, if a country loosens its credit, interest rates fall, and if the interest rate level is lower than other countries, it will cause a large outflow of capital, reduce foreign capital inflows, and worsen capital account balances. At the same time, the currency will be sold on the foreign exchange market. , Causing the exchange rate to fall.

Under normal circumstances, when US interest rates fall, the trend of the US dollar will be weak; when US interest rates rise, the trend of the US dollar will be biased. From the price changes of US Treasury bills (especially long-term Treasury bills), the trend of US interest rates can be explored, which can help predict the trend of the US dollar. If investors believe that U.S. inflation is under control, the interest income of existing Treasury bills, especially short-term Treasury bills, will be favored by investors, and bond prices will rise. Conversely, if investors believe that inflation will intensify or worsen, then interest rates may rise to curb inflation, and bond prices will fall. In the first half of the 1980s, the US dollar remained strong despite the existence of a large trade deficit and a huge fiscal deficit. This was the result of the high interest rate policy implemented by the United States, which prompted a large amount of capital to flow from Japan and Western Europe to the United States. The trend of the US dollar is greatly affected by interest rate factors.

### **C. Inflation**<br>

After the 1970s, as floating exchange rates replaced fixed exchange rates, the impact of inflation on exchange rate changes became more important. Inflation means an increase in the domestic price level. When the prices of most goods and services in an economy generally rise for a period of time, it is said that the economy is experiencing inflation.

Since price is a currency expression of the value of a country’s commodities, inflation means that the amount of value represented by the country’s currency has fallen. Under the condition that domestic and foreign commodity markets are closely related to each other, generally, inflation and domestic price increases will cause a decrease in exports and an increase in imports, which will affect the supply and demand relationship in the foreign exchange market and lead to fluctuations in the country’s exchange rate. . 

At the same time, the decline in the internal value of a country’s currency will inevitably affect its external value and weaken the credit status of the country’s currency in the international market. People will expect that the currency’s exchange rate will tend to weaken due to inflation, and hold the currency in their hands. 

The national currency is converted into other currencies, which causes the exchange rate to fall. According to the law of one price and the theory of purchasing power parity, when the inflation rate of one country is higher than the inflation rate of another country, the actual value of that country’s currency is decreasing relative to that of another country’s currency, and the country’s currency exchange rate will be decline. Otherwise, it will rise. For example, before the 1990s, an important reason for the strong exchange rate of the Japanese Yen and the former West German Mark was that the inflation rates of these two countries had been very low. 

The inflation rates of the United Kingdom and Italy are often higher than the average level of other Western countries, so the exchange rates of the currencies of these two countries are in a downward trend. Specifically, there are three main indicators for measuring the changes in the inflation rate: the production price index, the consumer price index, and the retail price index, which we will discuss separately below.

***(1) The meaning and interpretation of the producer price index (PPI)***<br>
The Producer Price Index (Producer Price Index) is a measure of the price index of goods sold by manufacturers and farmers to stores. It mainly reflects the price changes of the means of production, and is used to measure the cost price changes of various commodities at different stages of production. Generally, the statistics department collects the quotation data of various products from major manufacturers, and then weights them into hundreds of decimals to facilitate comparison. For example, my country has a constant price in 1980 and a constant price in 1990. The United States uses the 1967 index as 100 for comparison. This indicator is published by the Ministry of Labor once a month, and it has a great impact on the future (usually after 3 months) price level rise or fall, and it also indicates the trend of the overall market price in the future. '

Therefore, the producer price index is a leading index of inflation. When the price of raw materials and semi-manufactured products rises, it will be reflected in the price of consumer products a few months later, which will cause the overall price level to rise, leading to inflation. Intensify. On the contrary, when the index drops, that is, the prices of production materials have a downward trend during the production process, it will also affect the overall price level and reduce the pressure of inflation. However, because the data did not include some commercial discounts, it could not fully reflect the real price increase rate, so that sometimes the effect was exaggerated. In addition, since agricultural products change seasonally and energy prices also change periodically, this has a great impact on the price index. Therefore, when using this index, food and energy prices must be sorted or excluded before analysis is appropriate.

In the foreign exchange market, traders are very concerned about this indicator. If the production price index is higher than expected, there is a possibility of inflation, and the central bank may implement a tightening monetary policy, which will have a positive impact on the country's currency. If the production price index falls, it will have the opposite effect.

***(2) The meaning and interpretation of the consumer price index (CPI)*** <br>
The Consumer Price Index (Consumer Price Index) is a measurement of the price of a fixed basket of consumer goods. It mainly reflects the changes in the prices of goods and services paid by consumers. It is also a tool to measure the level of inflation. It is expressed as a percentage change. . The main commodities that constitute this indicator in the United States are divided into seven categories, including: food, wine and beverages, housing; clothing; transportation; medicine and health; entertainment; and other commodities and services. In the United States, the consumer price index is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and there are two different consumer price indexes. One is the Consumer Price Index of Workers and Staff, or CPW for short. The second is the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers, referred to as CPIU.

The CPI price index indicator is very important and enlightening. It must be carefully grasped, because sometimes it is announced that the indicator has risen and the currency exchange rate is improving, and sometimes the opposite is true. Because the level of the consumer price index indicates the purchasing power of consumers and also reflects the economic situation, if the index falls, it reflects the economic recession, which will inevitably be detrimental to the currency exchange rate trend. 

But if the consumer price index rises, will the exchange rate be positive? Not necessarily, it depends on the "rise" of the consumer price index. If the index rises moderately, it means that the economy is stable and upward, which is of course beneficial to the country’s currency, but if the index rises too much, it will have an adverse effect, because the price index is inversely proportional to the purchasing power. 

The more expensive the price, the lower the purchasing power of the currency. , It is bound to be detrimental to the country’s currency. If you consider the impact on interest rates, the impact of this indicator on foreign exchange rates is more complicated. When a country’s consumer price index rises, it indicates that the country’s inflation rate has risen, that is, the purchasing power of the currency has weakened. 

According to the purchasing power parity theory, the country’s currency should weaken. Conversely, when a country’s consumer price index falls, it indicates that the country’s inflation rate has fallen, that is, the purchasing power of the currency has risen. According to the purchasing power parity theory, the country’s currency should strengthen. 

However, since every country takes the control of inflation as its primary task, rising inflation will also bring opportunities for interest rates to rise, so it is actually good for the currency. If the inflation rate is controlled and falls, interest rates will also tend to fall, which will adversely affect the currencies of the region. Policies to reduce the inflation rate will lead to the "tequila effect", which is a common phenomenon in Latin American countries.
