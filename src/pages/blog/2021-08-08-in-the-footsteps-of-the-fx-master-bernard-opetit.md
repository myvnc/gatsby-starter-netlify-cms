## **Bottom-up analysis: Experts who master the odds**

Bernard Opetit emphasized that the main target was individual companies, he studied a company and became an expert in that company. The opposite strategy is from top to bottom, first analyzing national policies and industries, and then individual companies. Bernard Opetit spent countless hours researching trading partners, trying his best to grasp the mentality of the company's management, shareholders, employees, correspondent banks, creditors, debtors, and the company's stock traders. He calculated the possible future development and stock price reaction. By cutting in from this perspective and directly collecting information, the odds of winning will naturally surpass those analysts who rely on second-hand information.

## **Case Study: Northwest Airlines**

"In 1993, we intervened in Northwest Airlines. The company had a financing merger and acquisition in 1989. Then, the entire aviation industry fell into a severe recession, with an overall loss of billions of dollars, and Northwest Airlines' performance plummeted. Observed from the balance sheet, Northwest Airlines had high bank debt at the time, but the number of bond issuances was very limited (if memory is correct, the total debt is about six or seven billion U.S. dollars, with the exception of 500 million U.S. dollars in bonds. The rest are bank debts). Due to the short-term trouble again, the company threatened bankruptcy. The company’s senior executives held strong negotiations with the bank group, employees, and suppliers. The attitude is very tough."

"Northwest Airlines began to win some concessions. The bank agreed to cancel interest charges and the share price of the collateral, and Boeing also agreed to delay the delivery of the aircraft payment. In order to achieve these major results, Northwest Airlines assumed a posture of bankruptcy. Every day, They always say through the media:'We intend to declare bankruptcy.' This is also the reason why the price of corporate bonds continues to fall. In the end, the price of a dollar worth of bonds is only 10 cents."

"According to my analysis, it is impossible for the company to go bankrupt. I think all this is a scary method. Of course, this method is very beneficial to the company, forcing the negotiating opponent to make concessions. For us, it is meaningless to engage in bond trading because of the scale. It’s too small. So we started buying Northwest Airlines’ debts. Of course, the results may be disastrous, but I believe the odds are higher. In short, we believe that Northwest Airlines is playing scary tricks."

"Once the negotiating opponent made concessions, everything miraculously returned to normal. The company began to announce some beautiful data. The bond price rebounded to parity, and we also made four or five times the profit. Later, the company went public, and the operating performance was still very good. ideal."

"The whole transaction involves a lot of basic analysis. Modern basic analysis requires dynamic research, especially in such special circumstances."

"Euro Disney is another very similar case. At that time, there was a type of Euro Disney convertible corporate bonds in circulation; when they were in trouble, just like Northwest Airlines, they used the media to create various noises to exaggerate the situation. Degree. They play with banks, shareholders, and everyone. But they don’t touch bonds, and the whole event has exactly the same development, including our profits."

"In the case of Euro Disney, bonds are convertible bonds, which are derivative trading instruments. This may be the reason why we have the opportunity to grasp the trading opportunities of price chaos, because many derivatives traders are not familiar with basic securities, and fundamentally Securities traders are not familiar with derivatives. If you understand both aspects at the same time, you can gain an advantage."

In-depth strategic thinking allows you to see things that others cannot see, and profit from it. Of course, this may not always be the case. An event may not have information or hidden issues that everyone has overlooked. In addition, hard work may not give you special insights. Special insights need to be cultivated through experience. Tracking the company's development through media reports is a good way to gain experience.

* Know all the players and pay attention to their words and deeds. The so-called players refer to people with a non-negligible influence, including groups. For example, the union may be an important player.
* Understand what they should say for their own benefit; or what benefits they say may bring. What is the motivation? What is the hidden issue? As long as interest is involved, any conversation cannot be trusted.
* Who is the biggest loser?
* Who are the biggest beneficiaries?
* For each interest group, what are the best, second, and third outcomes that they hope to happen?
* Where is the focus and influence of each interest group's manipulation of the development of the incident?
* How will each group react to each result? If one person does this, how might other people's reaction and subsequent development be?

Thinking about company events in this way is obviously a skill that needs time to develop. However, this can also add to the fun of trading. Finally, remember that for Opetit, prices are driven by corporate events, and corporate events are shaped by some powerful people. Power represents influence. Therefore, in the entire causal relationship of price changes, you should first consider: "Who has influence?" It is important to remember that for a certain company or a specific situation, many people have influence. Always keep an open mind and an objective stand. Like the story described by Opetit, the market is often a game of power. The Northwest Airlines case involved many people, including banks. The constant flow of power and influence makes it more difficult and more interesting for you to track company events

##  **Dynamic Analysis** 

Bernard Opetit introduced a very interesting concept. "Basic analysis is very important, but so is what I call'dynamic analysis'. You want to know what happened to a certain company, what someone did, what the purpose is, when you plan to do it, and to what extent. Anything. There must be a story behind the incident, and you must understand this story."

According to Bernard Opetit, corporate events cannot develop in a vacuum. There must be a context. It is important to understand the entire causal relationship and background.

"As far as stock trading is concerned, I think 99% of technical analysis is nonsense. This statement may not apply to foreign exchange, most commodities, indices and interest rates. Technical analysis is very important in these latter areas because these There is no uniform correct approach in this market. Even if your operation is quite unsatisfactory, the result may be better than simply ignoring it. However, I still want to emphasize that it is important to figure out the story behind it-who is going to do what." The protagonist may be Not the suppliers and shareholders of banks and companies, but the government, supply/demand relations and producers.

"All roads lead to Rome, and you can also make money through technical analysis alone. Although I personally don't know how to do it, I believe it can be done."

In the case of Northwest Airlines, Opetit used dynamic analysis. He wants to know the "story" in it. What is the motivation? Where is the focus of influence (in other words, who is the protagonist)? The analysis is dynamic because the situation is not static. What he cares about is not last year's income statement and balance sheet. Opertite deals with living and developing objects, which may change at any time and have a major impact on stock prices.

However, dynamic analysis may not always be the most suitable analysis tool. Bernard Opetit changed the method of analysis with different situations and types of transactions. This is very important, you must understand the type of market and time structure you are trading. For example, in a highly liquid market, a technical analysis is obviously more appropriate than a basic analysis. From another perspective, if the basis of the transaction is based on the economic outlook of a certain country in the coming months, a fundamental analysis should be more appropriate.

"I engage in many different types of transactions. For example, convertible arbitrage is one of them. This is a relatively pure derivative transaction. The motivation may be to buy implied price volatility and short historical price volatility. This This type of transaction is more suitable for technical analysis. For risk arbitrage, the nature of the transaction is quite different."
