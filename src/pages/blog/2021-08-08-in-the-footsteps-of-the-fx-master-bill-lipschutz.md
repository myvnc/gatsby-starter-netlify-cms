In the late 1980s, Bill Lipschutz served as the head of foreign exchange trading at Salomon Brothers. Currently, he is a manager of Hather Sage Capital Management. In the book "The New Financial Geek", Jack Schwarg described Bill Lipschutz as the largest and most successful foreign exchange trader at Salomon Brothers. This is not surprising at all, because Lipschutz’s single transaction amounts are usually as high as billions of dollars, and profits are often calculated in tens of millions of dollars. According to Schwarg's estimates, during Lipschutz's eight-year tenure at Salomon Brothers, he personally generated more than 500 million U.S. dollars in profits, which is equivalent to an average daily profit of 250,000 U.S. dollars during the eight-year period.

Manipulate other people’s funds
The source of funds for the transaction may affect the operating style and performance, and most people fear that it is difficult to understand this. As Bill Lipschutz explained, even the most experienced trader can hardly understand it unless he knows it firsthand.

"At the beginning, I didn't understand the difference. Seven years ago, I thought very simply that no matter whether the capital came from Salomon Brothers, or from ten wealthy individuals, from a single client, the result would be nothing. Different. My goal is to extract the maximum profit from the market. In fact, different sources of funds will inevitably lead to different trading strategies and force trading to change motivations. The problem is definitely not simply to say:'I have some funds on hand, Regardless of the source, I will do my best and try to earn some profit every day. "It's not that simple. When a company faces wealthy customers, it will naturally have many different forces involved. Each month's performance will determine your Life and death."

"Treasury management is a very tricky industry. The problem is not only operational performance, but also customer expectations for investment results. Absolute performance data is often misleading. I can say to you:'Over the past five years, the total number of our most active products The reward is 600%', you might say:'Oh! 600%!' However, if you don’t know the performance of other foreign exchange managers, or the risk we take to achieve this performance, the data itself is not clear. For example, suppose a manager manages US$200 million of funds, of which US$120 million is a fund with a specific investment objective. If this part of the fund earns 600% of the return within four years, the investor is very The capital may be recovered because the risk structure presented by the fund does not meet the expectations of investors. Fund management is a very complex game that often violates common sense."

"Let us consider the different trading methods between George Soros and Bit Lynch. Soros usually operates through a high degree of credit expansion, with the sole goal of making big money. The Magellan Fund managed by Bit Lynch is quite different. Interesting, the primary goal is to protect capital. He is in the majority, and he is also a top stock picker, so he made a lot of money. But, please believe me, as long as the performance of Magellan Funds starts to decline, you can see Investors withdraw a large amount of capital, and even the fund will disappear in the end. People who hand over the funds to George Soros must be psychologically prepared, and the value of the fund may suddenly drop by 20-30%. I think no one will diversify their investment. Investment. People’s motives are very different. Investors will choose funds that suit their style. Finally, customer preferences will definitely affect the trader’s trading style."

As explained by Bill Lipschutz, different sources of funds mean different customer motivations and fund operation objectives, and may also affect your trading style. As traders, we all need more capital. If the operation goes well, sooner or later we will need a new source of funds, or borrowing (no need to accept the norms), or raising client funds. Regardless of the source of funds, you must understand that as your trading style may be affected, it will also affect trading performance. The worst case is performance decline, and the funds are not their own. Therefore, before pursuing new funds, be sure to carefully evaluate how your trading will be affected.

## **Private capital**

The source of transaction capital is different, and the simplest one is self-owned funds. Bill Lipschutz explained how he operated his own funds.

"For pure speculative funds other than investment, I have a high endurance to take risks. In principle, if I lose all speculative funds, I can accept it. Of course, I don't think I will suffer a complete loss, but I definitely do. Psychological preparation in this regard. Now I hold some investments, including my own house, which is an investment, and I also hold a stock portfolio, which is also considered an investment. The rest of myself can be used for speculation, and I expect a higher rate of return For investment, but also prepared to accept higher risks and severe price fluctuations. The risk of destruction in this type of transaction is very high, in other words, 100% loss may occur."

For own funds, Bill Lipschutz only needs to be responsible for himself and can trade completely according to his own preferences. However, for other people's funds, the degree of freedom is obviously reduced, and he explains this next.

## **Other people's funds**

"However, when you are entrusted to manage the client's funds, it is another matter. The client said,'I know you are a speculative trader and I can accept a 20% loss frankly.' I often talk to my clients in detail. Try to understand what they think. I want customers to fully understand what we can and cannot do. If a customer looks directly into my eyes and says:'I can accept a 20% loss, no problem.' In this case, We know what he meant by 5%. If I call him three days later, "Do you know? Your net worth has fallen by 18%, I want to know what you think, so that I can discuss the next step." I promise , He must have forgotten the previous statement about the 20% loss."

Since the client is not a trader, once a serious loss occurs, the client may not be able to handle it properly. When you accept the entrustment to manage the client's funds, you are responsible for assisting them and not letting the client fall into an emotionally unprepared situation. You can't take the client's funds and simply speculate in the market.

"For a fund manager, if you buy IBM stock and the stock price drops by 25%, no one will ask anyone to walk because everyone owns IBM-this is a prudent investment. But if you buy one For online speculative stocks, the stock price rises 80% and then falls, and then the company goes bankrupt. You may have to leave behind. Clients will get their money back, and you may find it difficult to raise funds."

"The problem is not just the rate of return. There are many different motives involved in the customer's investment decision making. This will directly affect the level of the transaction. If the odds of a certain transaction are very high, why don't you invest more money? Well, because of a wrong judgment— -Even if the probability is only 5%-the result is far worse than the correct judgment, even if the judgment is correct, the probability is as high as 95%. Some traders think,'Hey! If I help clients earn 25%, they must be very happy and think I am Great trader, then I can earn a lot of management fees. "But, do you know? If a 5% loss occurs, they will withdraw the funds, and I may be closed for good." Therefore, the trading decision is not It's just about the odds of winning and losing, and the situation is much more complicated. Generally speaking, in addition to the probability of winning or losing a profit, traders must also consider a lot of related issues.

Therefore, the complexity of operating client funds far exceeds that of own funds. You must consider the possible outcome of the transaction and the possible reaction of the customer. Your decision is bound to be constrained by the customer's response, and then affect the performance of the operation. For the company's funds, the pressure is relatively small, and there is more room to play, Bill explains this next.

## **Company capital**

"Managing individual customers’ funds and protecting capital are the key goals. As a company’s trader, the goal is to make money. In addition, the company is more able to accept losses. For a company, the key is whether the company wants to intervene in foreign exchange transactions. Relatively speaking, the performance of individual traders will not affect the conclusions in this regard. For example, if a company incurs a loss of 20 million U.S. dollars, the trader may be fired, but it is very likely that foreign exchange trading will not be launched because of this. , The foreign exchange market itself will almost never be the object of blame."

Since the operation of other people’s funds must be subject to various restrictions, this may cause a question: "Why not take mortgage loans from banks, regardless of the performance of the operation, must pay off the borrowings?" Unfortunately, due to various practical difficulties, often Both must rule out this feasibility.

"First of all, if an investment bank or company is going to delegate the management of transactions or speculative products to an individual, they usually want that person to enter the company system. This is not to exclude the management of funds to others, but there are many sensitive issues involved. The problem, no matter who supervises the work in this area or approves the loan, it is likely to break the job. For example, suppose you hand over the funds to someone else to manage, in the event of a loss of millions, everyone will ask:'In the end Who approved it?' Then, you were fired. On the contrary, if the company transfers the funds to a department for management, this is the company's decision. If there is a loss, these decision makers will not lose their jobs."

In short, you must consider the various sources of funds available, comprehensively evaluate the gains and losses they may cause, and then make the final decision. If the hens laying the golden eggs will reduce their production due to foreign funds, is it worth it? In other words, if the transaction performance cannot be improved, what is the point of obtaining additional funds?

Therefore, before accepting new funds, you must consider the following questions:

1. What are the expectations expressed by the funding provider?
2. What are his real expectations?
3. Does my past operational performance meet the expectations of the fund provider?
4. Can my performance meet the real expectations of the fund provider?
5. If the expectation of the fund provider cannot be met, what will be the consequences?
6. How much control does the fund provider require?
7. How often does the fund provider evaluate the operational performance?
8. What is the personality of the fund provider? Is it difficult to deal with and keep asking for trouble?
9. Is it possible to set certain specifications?



## **Advantages of individual traders**

Of course, most traders do not work in large investment banks. Most traders use their free time and occasionally try a few trades. In contrast, individual traders are "David" and investment banks are "giants". The former lacks the latter's basic equipment, logistics personnel, research conditions, the latest information systems, analysis software and hardware, and also lacks peer competition. environment of. However, David also has some advantages that giants don't. In order to effectively defeat giants in the market, individual traders must give full play to their advantages.

**Advantage 1: No need to force transactions -**
Uncomfortable, but the chance of profit is higher. This is the advantage of refusal to deal. As Bill explained, the advantages of personal transactions in this regard clearly surpass those of professional traders in investment banks, who have to deal with the supervision of upper-level supervisors.

"If you work as a trader in a large institution, it may be difficult to say;'Today's market doesn't look right, let's read the newspaper', because the boss may have said earlier:'You don't trade, what newspaper do you read?' In fact, If a trader can reduce the number of transactions by 50%, he can usually make more money."

"250 trading days a year, assuming you make one trade every day, do you know what the final result will be? As a result, there are only five key trades, and the view of three trades is completely wrong, making you lose your ass. The two judgments are completely correct, and you have turned over. The remaining 245 trades are irrelevant-small gains and small losses. In many cases, it is not suitable for entering the market, but you reluctantly trade, and the result can only be expected. If you are not careful, you may also build a position with a poor chance of winning, which will result in heavy losses. There are only a few real winning or losing decisions."

"It is important to understand the benefits of'market outlook'. As a result, there is no appropriate market, and there is no high chance of winning, so don't enter the market reluctantly. The key to the entire trading game is to continue to grasp the advantage. The bet must be placed on the high chance of winning. If you always follow this principle, you can take the lead. Of course, the risk of destruction must be low enough so that you won’t be three or two out of the game because of three or two consecutive losses. So, suppose you work as a trader in a large institution. If someone is old It’s staring at you and saying, “You don’t take care of the trading position? Should you read the newspaper?” The correct answer is “exactly.” However, the management might not listen.”

**Advantage 2: Decision-making control procedures -** 
If you manipulate your own funds, you can do whatever you want. All decisions are controlled by you. In the same way, if you are not a floor trader and are engaged in the business of acting on behalf of clients, as long as the clients are all individual investors, there is still considerable room for sway.

"Individual investors will not call to bother you every day, because they don't care what position you hold-long, short or short hand. No matter where you are, you are the only decision maker: what to trade, what Time to trade or whether to trade. I smile because, just like you, I have been at this level for some time. I operate my own funds-you, me or every trader you are going to visit-we If the performance of the company is 480%, 200%, 80% or a certain level at a certain time, then it is absolutely impossible to succeed."

According to Bill, if you can fully grasp the trading decisions, the operating performance should be ideal, perhaps better than the professional traders of the bank. If an individual trader cannot achieve this level of performance, it will be difficult once someone is staring at you. When I discussed with Carvey Alamotti, head of the Derivatives and Arbitrage Department of Tokai Bank, he agreed with this view. I mentioned that my trading performance is not inferior to the star traders of investment banks. Regarding this point, I regret to say that these celebrity traders have "a little more" capital than mine!

**Advantage 3: Information -** 
Individual investors have more and more information, and they are no longer at the disadvantage of professional traders in this regard, or even in the same position. So, strictly speaking, no one can take advantage of information.

"As far as the speed of information transmission in 1997 is concerned, no one can fully digest it. No one can get the information first. Someone sitting in the living room of Kansas town watching TV, his speed of obtaining information will not lose to the speed of the information in the room. Trader. Ten years ago, because I was in Salomon and because I mastered information technology, the advantage obviously surpassed most people. My residence also has equipment from Reuters and Deloitte, and only a few traders in New York can do it. This. Now, all this is too ordinary."

"I hope my home is also equipped with an information system, otherwise I have to ask my colleagues in London about the market at the time like other traders. For me, this is equivalent to obtaining second-hand information. Therefore, through the Deloitte information system at home, I can work at any time and keep track of the development of the market at any time. Now, almost everyone has access to this kind of information, and the advantages of professional traders no longer exist."

**Advantage 4: flexibility and sensitivity -** 
We all know that behemoths are difficult to adjust flexibly, which can be explained by the laws of inertia in physics. There are similar rules in the trading field, which is the advantage that "David" has mastered.

"As a'sesame green bean', you can quickly adjust the company's orientation. Many small companies operate in many markets at the same time. For example, if a market suddenly has trading opportunities or undergoes structural changes, it may be difficult for a large institution to immediately Response. The larger the company, the more rubber stamps, and the more time-consuming adjustments. This is the characteristic of large organizations."

Traders must observe changes in the overall industry, just as the president of Coca-Cola must pay attention to changes in the entire soft drink market. Therefore, when laws and regulations are revised or other structural changes occur, it is easier for you to adjust products or change markets. In the entire trading career, this advantage may only be used once, but it is still worth remembering.

**Advantage 5: pressure -** 
The fate of small traders is completely controlled by their own hands, and relatively speaking, they usually do not succumb to the pressure of others. However, this may not be an absolute advantage.

"Compared to professional traders, individual traders are less pressured to be supervised. No one stares at you and says:'You must do this or should do that'. But, on the other hand, no one reminds you at any time. The norms you should have, such as:'You must immediately make a claim, this position is too big, that position is too small.' This may be a negative number. As a personal trader, there is no supervisor at stake to provide you with Suggestion. You might say,'This is a great deal, I want to stick to it', but in large institutions, there is usually an enthusiastic supervisor who will tell you,'There is no problem with this position, that position is too big. Your loss is too serious, you must play.'"

Therefore, as a personal trader, you must experience the positive benefits of external pressure (for example: mandatory regulations), so you must cultivate a spirit of self-discipline.

**Crazy dedicated enthusiasm -** 
Have you ever wondered what kind of psychology drives a person to do everything? The richest people in the world, why do they get up early every morning to work? Is it because of greed? Uncontrollable ambition? Arrogant? There is a close relationship between the answers to these questions and the realm of trading, which can explain how great achievers and great traders can rise to the great realm.

"If the motive of the transaction is money, the direction is obviously wrong. A truly successful trader must be integrated into the transaction. Money is only an incidental issue. Although this statement is not the first thing I put forward, I believe in this theory. Mainly. The motivation for success is not the glory of success. The wealth that success brings is usually just a by-product-in short,'the game itself is the key'."

In addition to motivation, enthusiasm and focus are more important. I think most people underestimate the importance of enthusiasm for success, especially for extraordinary success. Yes, trading is really interesting. That’s right, you’ve heard traders say: ‘I just love trading, and I do it without money. ’If you have been in this field long enough, you will find that some people-perhaps including yourself-spend countless hours reading and analyzing all kinds of materials, which have no obvious purpose, just because they are interesting. Some people stay up late and try to solve a math problem, and the same is true.

"In order to be at the top of trading, you must have a crazy enthusiasm. You can't think,'If I do this, I can buy a BMW, or if I do this, I can earn both fame and fortune'. Motivation of the transaction It must come from the heart, a dedication to solving problems. It is difficult to maintain this kind of enthusiasm throughout the long years of the trading career."

Unless you experience it yourself, it's hard to understand this kind of crazy enthusiasm. This is a high degree of concentration. Nothing else seems to exist, and there is nothing else in the field of vision. This kind of enthusiasm comes from the deepest layer of the psychological structure, and it shows extreme hard work.

"If you meet a very, very successful trader who sincerely believes that his success is because he is smarter, quicker, more understanding, and more positive, then you can question him. All successful traders They all have a common trait—whether they have a higher education or not—a strong understanding and hard work."

"Looking back to the school days, there are usually two types of students with good homework. First, they are very hard-working, well-organized, and efficient. They do their homework and exercises step by step, repeating and reviewing the content of each chapter of the text. The other type of people Less, they are very smart, do not need to work hard, have extraordinary understanding. You rarely see people who are really smart and have extraordinary understanding, and they work very hard at the same time. For top traders, they usually have this Two conditions. They are very smart, have a high level of understanding, work hard, and have strong organizational skills. They may seem messy, but they are not."

Bill Lipschutz has crazy enthusiasm, and very lucky, his mentor and learning idol also have the same characteristics.

"I know an English gentleman. He was working in the trading room of a market-making bank. We had a lot of business dealings. Then he joined Salomon. When I met him, he had been there for 10 years. 15 years of market experience. I followed him to learn the key to the real operation of the foreign exchange market. The right to choose theory is not very good, but his market experience is really very rich. He understands the operation of the foreign exchange market, the operation of market making activities, and the market flow. The crux of operation and market fluctuations, being able to grasp and focus on certain things, ignoring everything else. In three years, we became good friends by phone. Our backgrounds are quite similar. We are the only sons of the family and are very keen on trading. He works hard. He arrives at the office in Tokyo at 5 o'clock every morning, works until 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening, and then goes home to sleep for four hours. He has always been like this since I knew him for ten years. Of course, he had worked for many years before we met."

Wisdom, higher education, and the desire to make money, these conditions may bring success. However, talent and diligence are the keys to extraordinary success. If you want to know the secret of success, this is it.

"You have to be very smart and willing to work hard. You can find that many very smart people can't maintain long-term hard work because they don't want to invest time. The driving force should not come from the desire to make money. Money is just a by-product. You Must have enthusiasm and be integrated into the whole game."

***If people think you are crazy, this is on the right track***

Crazy enthusiasm is a rare quality that few people understand and even fewer possess. Because of this, when someone demonstrates this ability, they may become the laughing stock of everyone. Bystanders see successful people and hard-working people, but they don't think there is a connection between the two, and they are afraid that there is a connection between the two. Onlookers will comfort themselves with Freudian defensive mechanisms: "I don't want to succeed anyway, it's not worth it, and success doesn't necessarily require hard work."

"In this field, I think many people don’t understand the importance of enthusiasm and focus. For a hard-working trader, some people may think:'God! He wakes up at 5:30 every morning and continues on weekends. Work, there’s no life to speak of. I’m leaving here to go on holiday and play in Switzerland for three weeks. “Of course, I’m not saying that traders shouldn’t take a holiday. But it’s a matter of mentality. Top traders don’t leave the market often. , They don’t want to do that."

Bill Lipschutz's statement reminded me of a story. A woman said to the great violinist Franz Chrysler: "I am willing to trade my life for your violin playing skills!" "Dear lady," Chrysler replied, "This is exactly what I think." Next, Bill is ready to explain the reasons for these enthusiasm and perseverance.

"Every trader you interviewed in the book has a high degree of motivation. These motivations sometimes come from the deepest reason: maybe they came from a family with poor economic conditions, some people may be based on inner reasons. Struggling, perhaps because their father was very successful, causing psychological pressure on him. But no matter what the motive is, it is difficult for you to grasp. In short, everything lies in the enthusiasm of concentration, which is really strange in the eyes of others. People think: ' What is going on with that guy? Always working, either doing this or doing that.'"

"I think one thing is very helpful to my trading career. I always think about market conditions, how they work, and try to judge the trend of exchange rates. I don't think:'God, I give up getting along with friends At the same time, I gave up the weekend and stayed here, I gave up sleep. "I don't have this kind of mentality, I just want to trade."

"Extraordinary success has to pay a price, and many people are not prepared to pay this price. For those who lack the ability, they have no bargaining chip to pay the price. For those who are crazy to invest, they hardly need to pay the price-they love it. jobs."
