## **Why take risks?**

Risk-taking activities existed in prehistoric times. As far back as 3500 BC, the Hindu classics recorded the gambling game of craps. Therefore, Bit Bernstein mentioned in the book "Confrontation with the Sky", "The modern concept of risk comes from the Indian-Arab digital system, which was introduced to the West seven or eight hundred years ago." Take the risk. Not only is it an ancient game and way of profiting, this mentality is also the foundation of all economic development. In fact, if people are unwilling to take risks, there will never be any form of development. Without people who take risks, there will be no commercial contracts or sales transactions, and no services at all. In other words, if no one is willing to take risks, the entire civilization will inevitably come to a halt.

"If you don't do anything, nothing can be achieved. You have to take a step forward, take certain actions, you have to grit your teeth and take risks. A good trader has to engage in certain behaviors that are considered high-risk. We took risks and worked hard to obtain the Dow Jones contract. We won, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange lost. Of course, we are very happy that the final result is like this. We also take risks in the contract connection of the London International Financial Futures Exchange. Many members. They all oppose this connection. Their concept is very narrow. They always think that the contract started in Chicago and should end in Chicago."

"Regarding our new transaction building, I also take the risk-the latest technology building worth 182 million US dollars, an area of ​​60,000 square feet of trading center. The former chairman thinks that the risk is too high and the controversy is too high, but I believe this is our win The main reason for the Dow Jones contract. Regarding this, the members put me under a lot of pressure. They think that the investment is too much and the debt is too heavy. I think the same is true for the transaction. You have to take a step forward and take the risk."

## **Risk Management**


As long as there is risk-taking behavior, there is a need for risk management, and there is a need to clearly measure risks. Although risk represents the probability of uncertainty and adverse events, insurance represents the benefits of adverse events. Thanks to insurance, the risk can be reduced to the extent that we feel acceptable, making us willing to engage in risky behaviors. In principle, the benefits provided by risk-bearing behavior do not come entirely from the risk initially assumed, but also include the risk management benefits provided by insurance means, so that the risk is not too high to prevent us from engaging in a certain behavior. The product guarantee is insurance. Observing the overview of second-hand cars is also insurance. The salesperson’s verbal promise is also insurance. Without insurance, people are willing to take less risk, making progress and development more difficult.

Next, Pat Arbor explains how top traders take risk and manage risk. "I think that top traders must have a preference for stability, but this stability cannot be too high, because trading inevitably involves a certain degree of risk. A trader must have an ideal psychological structure, the ability to take risks, and Courage and psychological stability. I think that good traders should have a higher risk appetite than normal or ordinary traders. Therefore, the question is how to manage risk and how to cultivate self-discipline in risk management."

"Traders must be able to manage risks. I think this is also related to self-discipline. A top trader once told me,'The key to winning or losing is not how to establish a deal initially, whether it is buying or shorting'; After the position, assuming other conditions remain unchanged, there are only three possible developments for the market: rising, falling or remaining unchanged. The key is how you manage the position after the position is established. If your judgment is wrong, is there a strategy to exit the market? If the market is heading What do you do if you develop in an unfavorable direction? In most cases, traders always take the wrong actions."

The risk management decision that Pat Arbor discussed is how to reduce the risk of further development of adverse events and increase the probability of favorable events. He offers a few different ways to deal with it.

"Of course, you have no way to pre-arrange every coping strategy, but as long as the market starts to develop in an unfavorable direction, it is best to immediately consider appearances or alternative strategies. You usually don’t have much reaction time and the action must be fast. Obviously you can establish Reverse option position-this is a countermeasure. You can use options or futures to neutralize the existing position. You can also end the position. However, there is one thing that you absolutely cannot do: overweight and flatten. Once the position has suffered a loss, the first principle is "cannot increase the size". Obviously, your judgment has been wrong. Only when the market reverses and returns to the original entry price, and the position has already made a profit, then you can consider increasing the size. Never let the loss-making position sink deeper and deeper."

Pat Arbor manages risk through offsetting, usually through spread or hedging strategies. The spread or hedging strategy consists of at least two parts. When one side makes a profit, the other side loses. In other words, this is an insured risk position.

"In most cases, the risks are balanced. Personally, I try to engage in spread trading or arbitrage trading. If I go long soybeans in one month, I usually sell soybeans in another month. I mostly work in soybeans. Or the spread of public debt. If you are long-term public debt, then short the 10-year medium-term public debt. In some cases, I will simply go long for a certain commodity, but I will still achieve some balance, such as long corn/short soybeans , Or make more soybeans/shorten corn."

"As far as possible, try to use apples against apples, but you can also consider apples against oranges when necessary, but never use apples against elephants, and don't try to establish a hedge position on two completely unrelated products, because of their Profits and losses cannot be offset by each other. Let me give you an example. I just got on the line with the Australian Wheat Chamber of Commerce, which often uses our market. Australian wheat is hard red winter wheat and its quality is higher than the soft winter wheat traded on the Chicago Futures Exchange. Soft red winter wheat is not very good for edible wheat (a high-grade feed), but the market depth and liquidity are ideal. Although the Australian Wheat Chamber of Commerce is engaged in exporting, but trying to avoid risks outside Australia, they use soft red winter wheat Even though the basis of the two types of wheat is often different. Even so, the prices of the two types of wheat will still trend in the same direction, and the relationship between each other is sufficient for hedging. This situation is probably similar to that of an orange versus a lemon. If necessary, the safe-haven can accept any safe haven. Where you need shelter from the wind, you need to manage the risk. So, if a ship encounters a storm at sea, it needs to enter the harbor to shelter from the wind—any port is fine.”

“The same is true for large international hedging. Although the products are not exactly the same, they are close enough. Take the Chicago Futures Exchange’s bond market as an example. Dealers of real estate mortgage debt often use our 10-year contract, although they Hope to hedge against the 7-year risk position. They use a 10-year contract, and after some adjustments, it is enough to avoid the 7-year risk of the fundamental product."

"After trading every day, if you ask a pure spread trader:'Is today's market going up or down?' He may have no idea. However, if you ask him what the closing price difference of soybeans from November to July is, He can tell you exactly: '158-168'. He knows the exact ratio spread between corn and soybeans or long-term bonds and 10-year mid-term bonds, and the spread between the S&P index and the Nasdaq index or the S&P 100 spot index. Therefore, spread or arbitrage traders may not know or care about the rise and fall of the market. As long as the market or price fluctuates, they will find a way to make money. As long as there is confusion, they can come up with ideas."

"I remember a transaction that occurred in the 1970s when a large grain trader placed an order to buy soybeans. On the same day, due to some bad news, the price of soybeans fell by a limit. The important thing is that the soybean price difference between November and January was determined by the November price. The 34 cents higher fell to 17 cents higher. However, there were still transactions in November and January contracts, and the contract price in November was 34 cents higher than the contract in January. For example, the contract price in January was $7, the contract for November is $7.34."

"A certain world's largest trader placed an order to buy November soybeans. They planned to buy $500,000 bushels of November soybeans, and I sold them 100. At that time, I was not a veteran. I entered the market at 7 dollars. I bought 100 lots of January soybeans, shorted November soybeans at $7.34, and then asked the spread trader on the floor, "How much is the price from January to November?" He replied: "I will sell you for 17 cents in November. 17 cents higher.' He and I completed a 100-lot transaction at 17 cents and made $17,000. This grain trader bought a contract of 500 lots, so they wasted 5*17,000 dollars, which is equivalent to 85,000. U.S. dollars. I ran to the counter and told the person who took the order about the whole situation. He said:'If someone tells me to buy November soybeans, I will buy November soybeans.' I told him:'But you can buy January soybeans. , And then trade spreads, you can save $85,000.'Yes, they just make mistakes."

"So, spread traders must grasp these opportunities. People sometimes make mistakes and sometimes the market is out of order. In the 1970s, Hunter Brothers was active in the silver market, and they began to buy in large quantities on the Chicago Futures Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. When entering silver, the prices in these two markets are often out of order. If the price of silver in Chicago is higher than that in New York, arbitrage traders will enter the market, making the out-of-order phenomenon return to normal. This is why the market is an important mechanism for determining prices, because it Will adjust by itself. The market may be out of order, but the market can correct itself."

"As far as the aforementioned silver speculation is concerned, the Hunter brothers were really destroyed by the United States. When the Americans saw that the price of silver had risen to $50 per ounce, they began to move out of the silverware in the dining cupboards, and the melting silver factories in the United States also The establishment has sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, and a large amount of silverware is melted into silver bullion and shipped to the exchange for delivery."

"Sometimes there will be out-of-order phenomena, but the market will quickly adjust itself, whether it is the business hall of the Chicago Futures Exchange or the speculative trading outside the market. Seeing Hunter Brothers staged an empty market, all over the country Silver has run out, and silver supply has skyrocketed. The truth is exactly the same. As long as there is a disorder, you must seize the opportunity."

"Not long ago, I also saw a similar situation with the German bond contract. The Chicago Futures Exchange also provided the German bond contract, and it was quite successful. The daily parity transaction volume was about 8,000 to 9,000. Because Chicago's offer is two times higher than the ATP. , Third gear, I think everyone is very excited, arbitrageurs began to buy in ATP, short on the Chicago floor. Now, we have many markets for trading, providing many ways to balance risks."

"You are engaged in spread trading, or it may be because you are unwilling to continue to accept the risk of simple positions. You may be optimistic about a certain market and go long in a certain position, but the progress is not smooth. You want to continue to hold positions, but consider establishing some Hedge positions to reduce risks. If you establish a pure long position of soybeans, you may be able to short some soybean cakes or soybean oil, or even short corn, to offset some risks. If the development of the S&P index position does not go well, you can short some bonds. Although continue Keep the position, but reduce the risk while also reducing the profit potential. Of course, you can simply claim compensation, but if you think your opinion is correct, you may be able to adjust the original position to a spread transaction. So, you may let The whole situation is a little more neutral and reduces the risk of loss. I don’t think this is a very clever strategy. As I said, the initial loss is often the smallest loss, and the correct approach may be to go straight out."

The use of spreads or hedging strategies as a means of risk control may not be suitable for everyone. Pat Arbor discusses this next.

## **Proper style**


"You have to decide what type of trader you are: speculator, spread trader or short-term trader. You must find your own suitable trading style. Personally, I am a spread trader. In order to find the right trader Style, just look at where you are more profitable. Some people came to my office and said:'I am an outstanding trader.' I replied:'Yes.' They said:'I know how to proceed. Trading.' I still answered:'Yes.' They said:'I can predict the rise and fall of the market.' I still answered:'Yes, but the key is whether you can make money.'"

"Our industry is different from other industries. You may be a very good writer, but there is no absolute objective judgment standard. Even if you make a lot of money, you may still be the worst writer in the world, although you can make money by writing, but It does not represent your success in the field of writing. However, in our industry, making money is the key, representing your level of excellence. You may be a good lawyer, but no one knows. You may win some reputation, but There is a direct measurement standard in our industry, and this is the key. So, I will say:'You are not a good trader because you are not making money.'"

Therefore, although hedging is an ideal way to manage risk, whether you should become a safe-haven trader depends entirely on whether your personality can make money through this method.

## **From small to big: step by step**


In order to obtain the best trading results and long-term profits, trading should be done in a gradual and orderly manner. I have never seen any good trader who advocates crazy gambling to create spectacular home runs.

"I think the so-called best trader should be the kind of stable trader who intends to earn a little every day and accumulate more. Of course, you have heard many success stories of home run kings, but if you study home run players Compared with the players who try to hit every day, you can find that the former has a much lower success rate than the latter. Therefore, good traders are always those who accumulate capital for a long time. If you want to get it all at once, it’s too difficult."

"I remember once explaining this to an Italian trader,'one bean per day'. If you try to put only one bean in the bag a day, one at a time, then there will be 31 beans in a month. On the contrary, if Try to put in 31 beans at a time, it may be spread all over the floor, maybe not even a single bean. So, it’s best to take your time, grow from small to large, and accumulate less. Of course, if you see George So Ross or Niederhoffer, I am afraid that would not think so; but if you plan to make a living by trading the Dragon Slayer, you will end up dying under the Dragon Slayer."

“A top trader once told me, but I’m not sure if I agree with the point of view. This is what Lee Stern said, “Throughout your trading career or accumulating capital, you often lose three points. One of the capital, and then you will pull it back, and the capital will gradually grow, but you may have another one-third of the loss, and then you will slowly pull it back'. Just like climbing a staircase, go forward three steps, Take a step back and stick to this procedure, and you can still move forward slowly."

"Not trading is a kind of self-discipline-a very important norm. Many people don't understand this. Many people think that you have to stand there all day and always have to stay in the market. In some cases, the market is very dull. If the liquidity is not good, you should not trade. In other cases, the market fluctuates very sharply and it is completely unreasonable, and you should not trade. Of course, the former situation is more common. In the absence of market conditions, some Short-term traders who grab the hat still insist on staying there. They set up positions just to pass the time, but it is easy to get in and out. I always advise them:'It should not be traded, there is no market. Take it easy and walk around , Go have a cup of coffee.'"

## **Categorically confess**


For any trader, the most difficult part is often how to judge the right time to exit. Pat Arbor offers some suggestions to let you master these opportunities.

"First of all, if there is an unfavorable trend in the market and a loss in the position, this is of course the first warning sign. Second is your tolerance for pain and your ability to tolerate loss. If the loss is not large, you can tolerate it, but it will accumulate to a considerable amount. After the injury is constituted, you know that the problem is serious and you should play."

"This is generally measured by the degree of pain-the pain of loss of funds, the pain of injury to self-esteem. However, in general, the principle of trading is that'the first loss is often the smallest loss'. At the beginning, The loss is not too serious. This is usually the best time to plead compensation. If there is a loss, but the situation is not serious, and the market is hovering there, you can probably tolerate it. However, if the situation continues to deteriorate, you don’t need to think about it. Should be there at that time."

Some people will set some clear standards, especially those trading advisors, set a certain percentage of stop loss. For example, the loss cannot exceed 3% or 5% of the funds. "

"I am a floor trader and rely entirely on intuitive reactions. However, some traders still use a percentage or a specific amount of stop loss. The calculation standard can be your total property, transaction capital or the funds of a single transaction."

"I have seen some floor traders who immediately plead for compensation as long as they lose money, but they will always plead for compensation. I especially remember a trader who may have some psychological obstacles to pleading for compensation. I believe him to see A psychiatrist, a psychological consultant, or God knows what kind of expert. As a result, his behavior on the floor is suddenly different. Whenever a trade loses, he is very exaggerated. I hope everyone knows his determination to confess compensation. As far as I know, , Normal traders will pay by default."

"Did you know? The difficulty of acknowledging compensation is not entirely the loss of money, but also the injury of self-esteem. This is a mind game you play with yourself, because we all think we are smart and have confidence in ourselves. When you make a wrong judgment Time, not only hurts the wallet, but also hurts self-esteem. For example, if I buy at five yuan and the current price is three yuan, then I hope the price will return to five yuan, or at least more than three yuan. High. But the market is the boss, and the price is determined by it. The wisdom of the market is far beyond what we can understand. We must regard the market as the "dark blue" supercomputer that defeats the world chess king Gary Kasparov. The market is Will reflect any existing information, and then determine the price."

"The market is never wrong. No one is smarter than the market. I have seen many traders with an IQ of over 150, a Ph.D. or an MBA from Harvard University, but their trading performance is poor because they think they are smarter than the market. Every day at the end of the transaction, we pay or receive payments based on the settlement closing price. You must remember this. You can’t really beat the market. Some reverse-thinking traders try to go against the market and trade against the market. Some People are indeed very successful, but they are usually difficult. They try to short highs or buy lows. Although I know they all carry mathematical models or similar systems, this is still very dangerous."

**Pat Arbor’s message is**: The market is a fact of existence, not an object of competition. You cannot take the initiative, you can only react passively. You should not fight the market or try to beat it. With this kind of psychology in mind, it may be simpler to admit compensation.

**Do you want to become a trader?**
If you want to become a professional trader, let us hear what advice the chairman of the world's largest exchange has?

"When I first arrived at the Chicago Futures Exchange, I didn’t know much about the transaction, and I didn’t know what to do. The result of the first transaction...not to mention it. After a period of exploration, I was gradually able to judge success or failure. The dividing line of successful traders. Then, I started to study them and imitate them. I found that spread traders and arbitrage traders both drive luxury cars and lead a good life, so I decided to become a basis trader. In short, find some successful traders and copy them."

"Good traders have some qualities: shrewd and quick to respond to numbers. A few months ago, I just met David Kate. He was shrewd, responsive, very sharp, and a little bit reckless-this They are all the traits of a good trader. However, he also has the spirit of self-discipline, is quite cool, with a little'dominant'. Some traders can handle many things at the same time. He can listen to you, talk to another person, and observe the first The actions of three people. In short, you must have the patience to count and be able to do everything well."

"I found that floor traders have some sports cells, and most good traders have sports cells. Of course, there are some exceptions. My good friend Richard Dennis is like this, but he still plays tennis frequently. You must have a strong desire to compete, and the hand-eye-heart coordination must be good. You must have the blood of competition in your body. There are some American football players, basketball players, and track and field players in our company. They perform best on the trading floor. Good athletes may be tennis, perhaps because they have better hand-eye-heart coordination and have received some psychological training."

"Over-the-counter and on-exchange trading are very different. Trading off-exchange requires more patience and information, and you should trade from a longer-term perspective, because it is difficult for you to accumulate small profits. OTC trading requires higher self-discipline Spirit, if you have sufficient competitiveness, trading on the floor is relatively simple."

"When I first stepped into the market, the competition was not so fierce-you just need to enter the market, find some successful traders, and imitate them. Now, the situation is completely different. The real big players are often those markets. Foreign traders and institutional traders use sophisticated technology and sophisticated pricing models. They are more able to analyze the market accurately. Maybe you should go this way."

"If you are going to step into this industry, I think you should pay attention to the trading methods of those asset management companies. It is usually arbitrage between one month and another, sometimes between European stocks and American stocks. Arbitrage-they have this kind of information and skills."

"Amateur traders are difficult to make money. According to research data, about 85% to 95% of clients of traders like Linde Waldock lose money. First of all, their initial venture capital is too small. The average is about 25,000 US dollars. Secondly, they usually give up their advantages and come in and out too frequently. Amateur traders have to pay higher commissions, the rules of the game are not fair. If you belong to this type of trader, you should probably consider Option trading, buy buy option or buy sell option."

"If you plan to engage in trading, you have to invest all your time. Trading is quite tempting because it seems simple. You should find a successful trader and provide sufficient information so that you can see how others are trading. Greenway The dealers in Governance, Connecticut, and New York are all pretty good."

## **Trading tactics:**

* Playing-Is the pain of staying on the court too great?
* You don’t need to be smarter than the market, and don’t let your self-esteem hinder you from acknowledging compensation early.
