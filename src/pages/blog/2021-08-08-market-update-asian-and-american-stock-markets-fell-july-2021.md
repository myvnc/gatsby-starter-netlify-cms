After the Fed's interest rate talks last week, the market has not changed much. Has it indicated anything? This time, we compared nearly two post-meeting statements.

The left and right of the attached table are the previous and current statement respectively. The deleted part and the horizontal line are added last time. The new part is shown in italics this time, and the unchanged part is omitted. 

According to the above statement,  it has deleted the saying about the spread of Covid-19, but added the sentence that the economic activity and employment is already moving towards the goal, and will "review the progress" in a future meeting. Note that reviewing the progress of quantitative easing vs. reducing debt purchases are theoretically two different things. However, the wind was heard, and inflation was imminent, and the day of taking care of it was not long before the market had predicted that there would be no response.\
\
As for other changes, such as "continues to", they all pave the way for reducing debt purchases, but "have not fully recovered" is an explanation of the inaction. The statement seemed "too general", so the market reacted little. However, at the end of the meeting he admited that he "has had an in-depth discussion to reduce the purchase of debt." In addition, Jackson Hole also had an opportunity to let go in August, so the announcement in September was not surprising.\

Last weekend, the US Exchange temporarily held 91.80. Both Asian and American stock markets fell, and the US Exchange did not dare to look back too much, at most 91. In other words, the euro can be seen at 1.20, the Swiss franc at 0.90, the pound at 1.41, the yen at 108.60, and the Canadian dollar at 1.23. Australia and New Zealand are particularly weak in this round of recovery. The former is less than 0.75, while the latter barely sees 0.71. Hong Kong dollars continues to move towards 7.78, and see if the officer will jump out and open his eyes and lie that he has made a lot of money.
