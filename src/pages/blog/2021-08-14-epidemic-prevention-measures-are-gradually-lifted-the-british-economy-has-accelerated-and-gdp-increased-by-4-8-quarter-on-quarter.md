On Thursday (Aug. 12th), the United Kingdom announced that the second quarter GDP increased by 4.8% quarter-on-quarter, reversing the 1.6% decline in the previous quarter, in line with market expectations; the three-month GDP as of the end of June increased by 22.2% year-on-year.

A record high, getting rid of the five-quarter consecutive decline; monthly, GDP increased by 1%, which is the fifth consecutive month of rising. Mainly benefited by the gradual lifting of the UK's epidemic prevention measures, retail, catering and hotel industry activities rebounded sharply.

Statistics from the Bureau of Statistics show that service industry output increased by 1.5% month-on-month in June, and food and beverage services increased by more than 10%. Manufacturing output rose 0.2% month-on-month, and industrial output fell 0.7% month-on-month.

The UK is recovering rapidly from the worst recession in the past three centuries. GDP is currently only about 2.2% lower than before the outbreak. The Bank of England expects to return to its pre-epidemic level by the end of this year. However, some Bloomberg economists believe that as the local epidemic rebounds, economic growth may slow to below the Bank of England’s forecast.

In addition, the IMF last month raised the UK’s 2021 GDP growth forecast to 7%, which is tied with the United States among the seven largest industrial countries (G7). The speed of vaccination is a key reason. At present, 59.8% of the population in the United Kingdom has completed two doses of the vaccine; while the United States has reached 50.9%. In contrast, Japan’s vaccination rate is the lowest among the G7, with only 35.8% of the population completing the vaccination. Therefore, the IMF’s forecast for Japan’s economic growth this year is also the lowest among the G7, only 2.8%.

**The number of initial jobless claims in the United States has fallen for three consecutive weeks**

The number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the United States at the beginning of last week fell from 387,000 to 375,000, which was a three-week decline and was in line with market expectations. As for the number of people who continue to claim unemployment benefits, it has decreased from 2.98 million to 2.866 million, which is expected to be 2.88 million.

The improvement in economic activity in the United States has caused the number of job vacancies to hit a record high. The market generally predicts that the number of chief jobless rescuers will continue to decline in the next few months. However, the Delta virus strain has caused the epidemic to rebound and still poses a certain risk.

\
According to Bloomberg reports, currently about half of the U.S. states have ended the epidemic relief plan early, because companies have complained that the plan makes people unwilling to work and makes it difficult for companies to fill job vacancies. The original plan should be due by September.
